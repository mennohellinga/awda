# GE3V17043 --- Soldiers, Guerrillas, Terrorists
# Data analysis for the Atomwaffen posts in the leaked Iron March database
# M. Hellinga, 12 Nov. 2019 - ENDDATE
#
# This program will:
#   --- describe the tables relevant to researching the AWD organisational
#       structure
#   --- create a list of users who post on the AWD
#   --- export its results in LaTeX
#
# INPUT:
#   The directory from which the program is called, must contain a subdirectory
#   called data, which must contain the following files, all of which are
#   output by the scripts, contained in the torrent, which convert the original
#   database to sqlite3.
#       --- core_members.db
#       --- core_message_posts.db
#       --- core_message_topics.db
#       --- core_search_index.db
#
# OUTPUT:
#   The program will make a directory called LaTeX in its working directory.
#   If it already exists, all data will be cleared from it. The following
#   files will be created:
#       --- master.tex: the coordinating, master document. This file brings all
#               the others together.
#       --- core_members_description.tex: describes the table containing all
#               known Iron March members at the time of the snapshot.
#       --- core_message_posts.tex: describes the table containing all known
#               private messages on Iron March
#       --- core_message_topics.tex: describes the table containing all known
#               thread topics on Iron March
#       --- core_search_index.tex: describes the table containing all known
#               forum posts on Iron March.
#       --- awd_posters.tex: a table of all users who posted about the AWD
#
# OPERATING SYSTEM:
#   This program has only been tested on a Linux system.
#
# CAVEATS:
#   This program will not work if it does not have rwx access to its working
#   directory and all its subdirectories.
#
#   This program will not work if the specified input files are absent.
#
#   This program might not fail gracefully.
